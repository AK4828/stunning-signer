<p>This package implements SAX2-specific transformation APIs. It provides
  classes which allow input from {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler}
  events, and also classes that produce org.xml.sax.ContentHandler events. It
  also provides methods to set the input source as an
  {@link org.xml.sax.XMLReader}, or to use a
  {@link org.xml.sax.InputSource} as the source. It also allows the
  creation of a {@link org.xml.sax.XMLFilter}, which enables
  transformations to "pull" from other transformations, and lets the transformer
  to be used polymorphically as an {@link org.xml.sax.XMLReader}.</p>
<p>The {@link toolkit.xml.transform.sax.SAXSource} class allows the
  setting of an {@link org.xml.sax.XMLReader} to be used for "pulling"
  parse events, and an {@link org.xml.sax.InputSource} that may be used to
  specify the SAX source.</p>
<p>The {@link toolkit.xml.transform.sax.SAXResult} class allows the
  setting of a {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler} to be the receiver of
  SAX2 events from the transformation. 
<p>The {@link toolkit.xml.transform.sax.SAXTransformerFactory} extends
  {@link toolkit.xml.transform.TransformerFactory} to provide factory
  methods for creating {@link toolkit.xml.transform.sax.TemplatesHandler},
  {@link toolkit.xml.transform.sax.TransformerHandler}, and
  {@link org.xml.sax.XMLReader} instances.</p>
<p>To obtain a {@link toolkit.xml.transform.sax.SAXTransformerFactory},
  the caller must cast the {@link toolkit.xml.transform.TransformerFactory}
  instance returned from
  {@link toolkit.xml.transform.TransformerFactory#newInstance}.

<p>The {@link toolkit.xml.transform.sax.TransformerHandler} interface
  allows a transformation to be created from SAX2 parse events, which is a "push"
  model rather than the "pull" model that normally occurs for a transformation.
  Normal parse events are received through the
  {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler} interface, lexical events such as
  startCDATA and endCDATA are received through the
  {@link org.xml.sax.ext.LexicalHandler} interface, and events that signal
  the start or end of disabling output escaping are received via
  {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler#processingInstruction}, with the
  target parameter being
  {@link toolkit.xml.transform.Result#PI_DISABLE_OUTPUT_ESCAPING} and
  {@link toolkit.xml.transform.Result#PI_ENABLE_OUTPUT_ESCAPING}. If
  parameters, output properties, or other features need to be set on the
  Transformer handler, a {@link toolkit.xml.transform.Transformer} reference
  will need to be obtained from
  {@link toolkit.xml.transform.sax.TransformerHandler#getTransformer}, and
  the methods invoked from that reference. 

<p>The {@link toolkit.xml.transform.sax.TemplatesHandler} interface
  allows the creation of {@link toolkit.xml.transform.Templates} objects
  from SAX2 parse events. Once the {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler}
  events are complete, the Templates object may be obtained from
  {@link toolkit.xml.transform.sax.TemplatesHandler#getTemplates}. Note that
  {@link toolkit.xml.transform.sax.TemplatesHandler#setSystemId} should
  normally be called in order to establish a base system ID from which relative
  URLs may be resolved. 
<p>The
  {@link toolkit.xml.transform.sax.SAXTransformerFactory#newXMLFilter}
  method allows the creation of a {@link org.xml.sax.XMLFilter}, which
  encapsulates the SAX2 notion of a "pull" transformation. The following
  illustrates several transformations chained together. Each filter points to a
  parent {@link org.xml.sax.XMLReader}, and the final transformation is
  caused by invoking {@link org.xml.sax.XMLReader#parse} on the final
  reader in the chain.</p>
